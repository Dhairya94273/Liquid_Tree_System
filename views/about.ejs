      Revolutionary bio-technology combining microalgae cultivation with urban air purification. 
      Liquid Trees are vertical structures that photosynthesize CO₂ and produce oxygen, 
      providing an efficient solution for combating air pollution in dense metropolitan areas.

<!-- ABOUT CARDS SECTION -->
<div class="about-cards">
  <div class="card">
    <h3>What are Liquid Trees?</h3>
    <p>
      Liquid Trees are innovative outdoor installations that house microalgae (spirulina and chlorella) 
      in transparent vertical bioreactors. These structures absorb CO₂ from the air and produce oxygen 
      through photosynthesis, functioning like artificial trees but with superior efficiency.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>How They Work</h3>
    <p>
      The microalgae inside undergo photosynthesis, converting carbon dioxide into oxygen and biomass. 
      This process is 5x more efficient than real trees due to the high concentration of algae cells. 
      The system can absorb CO₂ from the surrounding air and release purified oxygen continuously.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
    <p>
      One Liquid Tree can absorb as much CO₂ in a year as an actual tree absorbs in 10 years. 
      This makes them ideal for urban environments where land is limited. They also improve 
      the aesthetic appeal while actively purifying the air.
